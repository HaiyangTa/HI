# HI emission decomposition

HI: Atomic hydrogen gas
H2: Molecular hydrogen gas

Estimate the cold HI gas fraction (Fcnm) and opacity correction factor (R) using supervised machine learning techniques.

FCNM is a crutial parameter to understand the transitions of atomic hydrogen gas from warm (WNM) to cold (CNM) phases and then to molecular clouds (H2).
